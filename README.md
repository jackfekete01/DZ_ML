This page provides code examples for synthetic experiments performed in "Classifying Detrital Zircon U-Pb Age Distributions using Automated Machine Learning." You can use this ReadMe as a guide to creating, downloading, and testing detrital zircon age distribution datasets in machine learning pipelines. 

## Creating or Downloading Data
First, we must create a dataset using the code above or download an example dataset from the Zenodo repository listed below.

### Zenodo Repository
Use the link below to download the example synthetic dataset:
https://zenodo.org/records/14532918
Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14532918

This dataset represents a 50-sample model for fixed age proportion data. Each file contains all of the data for each source from a set interval and number of analyses used to create each synthetic kernel density estimate (KDE).
